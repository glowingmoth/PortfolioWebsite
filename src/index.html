            <p>Glowing moth is an independant game developer founded in 2019 by Thomas Doig. At present there are a few games in pre-production as well as content being created for the Unity  community.
            When it comes to games, we want to create a balance between current technology and the nostalgic times from the 80's and 90's thanks to the gaming machines like Commodore Amiga.
